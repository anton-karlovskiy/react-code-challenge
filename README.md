Show a preview of a selected image  
Mark an image as a favourite  
Show the number of userâ€™s favourite images

## Requirements 
Use CRA for bootstraping your app (https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/)  
Use this API for fetching images: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos/  
Use this tech stack: react, redux, redux-saga, jest  
Cover non-react code with unit tests (eg. test reducers, do not test components)  
Assume that this application will be developed further
